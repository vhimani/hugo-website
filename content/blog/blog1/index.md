## Introduction

The purpose of this blog for me is to memoralize all the materials that I used into getting in a PhD program in Economics at UCI.

## Pre-Application Process

#### Transcripts
I completed bachelor’s degrees in Economics and Math from a 4-year, US-accredited university, where I fulfilled all required coursework. From early on, I had a clear intention to pursue a PhD and proactively prepared by speaking with others and gathering resources to strengthen my application when the time came. I didn't take any graduate courses rather worked on maximizing the math, statistics, and CS classes I could take outside of my economics curriculum.

#### Research
I enjoyed research and involved myself in a continuous RA fellowship at UT where I worked under the direct supervision of my PhD mentor. Additionally, I  had self-authored independent research through my undergraduate experience. I also worked with a policy institute through my senior year summer on similar research topics.

#### Letters of Recommendation
I met with my undergraduate thesis advisor early in May to discuss my intention to apply to PhD programs. He was very supportive and immediately offered to be one of my recommenders. My second academic recommender was a professor I had taken a class with and who had also helped me with some of my thesis programming. Unfortunately, I didn’t reach out to him until later in May, by which time he had already gone on paternity leave. I didn’t hear back from him until October, which definitely disrupted my original timeline. Fortunately, he responded in time before I started writing my essays. My third recommender was one of my mentors at my consulting job who had a PhD in Economics and have supervised my work on various projects.

#### Standardized Testing
I started studying for the GRE in June and took my first test in September. I wasn’t as well-prepared as I had hoped, largely due to the long consulting hours I was working at the time. Given how much emphasis is placed on achieving a perfect 170Q score, I definitely saw that as the weakest part of my application. The greatest tip would be to start preparing early and being consistent with the practice. Keeping an error log and a timer really helps!

## Applications
I preferred to stay in California, so I applied to several UC schools and also considered non-California programs based on the strength of their labor economics faculty. I compiled a list of all schools and deadlines and shared an application packet with my recommenders that included my CV and transcript.

## Post-Application

#### Interviews
Some schools scheduled interviews to discuss fit, which revolved around questions about my research interests, faculty fit, and why that school. These either resulted in acceptances or waitlists.
