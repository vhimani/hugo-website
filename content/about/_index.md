- Polymath Jr. Program: Co-authored research in combinatorial game theory applied to two-player abstract strategy games.
- Directed Reading Program, UT Austin: Authored and presented two papers on advanced topics in graph theory, including bipartite graph proofs and tree theorems.

I completed over 160 credit hours in 4 years during my undergraduate program, including numerous courses in Economics, Mathematics, Computer Science, and Statistics.
I am an avid data enthusiast with proficiency in Python, R, SQL, and Stata, and I have also worked with big data technologies like Apache Spark (in Databricks) and Microsoft Azure.
