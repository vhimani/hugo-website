## About

I currently work as a *Senior Research Analyst* in the METRICS group at **The Brattle Group** in San Francisco. My work spans a range of antitrust and competition cases, as well as projects across various practice areas, with a primary focus on data analysis and applied econometrics.

Prior to consulting, I engaged in research across a variety of academic and institutional settings:

- **Undergraduate Honors Thesis, UT Austin**  
  Conducted a yearlong, self-authored thesis analyzing the reallocation of time across activities during business cycles, with a focus on gender differences.

- **Texas Institute for Discovery Education in Science**  
  Analyzed student enrollment and outcomes data to support institutional decision-making.

- **The Conference Board**  
  Led an independent research project examining trends in employment and domestic migration during the COVID-19 pandemic.

- **Economics Undergraduate Research Fellowship, UT Austin**  
  Selected for six consecutive semesters to assist faculty-led research in applied econometrics.

- **Polymath Jr. Program**  
  Co-authored research in combinatorial game theory with applications to two-player abstract strategy games.

- **Directed Reading Program, UT Austin**  
  Authored and presented papers on advanced graph theory topics, including bipartite graphs and tree theorems.

I completed over 160 credit hours in four years at UT Austin, taking a wide array of courses in Economics, Mathematics, Computer Science, and Statistics. Iâ€™m an avid data enthusiast, proficient in Python, R, SQL, and Stata, with additional experience in big data technologies such as Apache Spark (via Databricks) and Microsoft Azure.
