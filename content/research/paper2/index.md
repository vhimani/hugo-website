##### Abstract

Tapatan and Picaria are traditional abstract strategy games. In this paper, we present a standard combinatorial analysis and game-theoretic analysis of these games and their generalizations to polygonal boards as well as a less standard analysis of the expected outcomes when the players only look ahead a fixed number of moves rather than laying optimally. Some variations are also analyzed.
