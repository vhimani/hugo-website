During the summer of my senior year, I collaborated with students from around the world on a combinatorial game theory project under the mentorship of [Prof. Johanna Franklin](http://johannafranklin.net/) (Hofstra University) through the **Polymath Jr REU** program. The program features collaborative research projects across diverse mathematical topics and operates in the spirit of the original Polymath Project. Each project is guided by an active researcher with a strong background in undergraduate mentoring.

##### Abstract

Tapatan and Picaria are traditional abstract strategy games. In this paper, we present a standard combinatorial analysis and game-theoretic analysis of these games and their generalizations to polygonal boards as well as a less standard analysis of the expected outcomes when the players only look ahead a fixed number of moves rather than laying optimally. Some variations are also analyzed.
