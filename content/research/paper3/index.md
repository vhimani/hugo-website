summary: "This post covers theoretic proofs written on topics in Graph Theory during my involvement in the Directed Reading Program at UT Austin."

I participated in the **[Directed Reading Program](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/drp/index.html)** through UT Austin's Department of Mathematics to explore theoretical mathematical concepts beyond the classroom in an informal, mentorship-based setting. I worked with [Dr. Feride Ceren Kose](https://ferideceren.com/), currently an Assistant Professor at the University of Georgia. During the program, I studied all Graph Theory chapters from *[Combinatorics and Graph Theory (Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics)](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-79711-3)*, published by Springer, and delivered two department-wide technical presentations.

### Paper 1: Bipartite Graphs

##### Abstract

In this paper we will discuss a special type of graph â€“ the bipartite graph. We will introduce relevant definitions, work through examples, prove a theorem, and then finally culminate our definitions and examples in the discussion of the application of the theorem.

### Paper 2: Matrix Tree Theorem and Cayley's Formula

##### Abstract
The talk explores the concept of counting trees in Graph Theory with Matrix Tree Theorem, and extends it to Cayley's formula. Alternatively, Prufer's method is also discussed. Proofs and related examples are worked out.
