I was awarded the **[Economics Undergraduate Research Fellowship](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/economics/undergraduate-program/academic-opportunities/undergraduate-research-in-economics-fellowship.html)** at UT Austin for six consecutive semesters (including summers) between June 2020 to May 2022. During this time, I supported the dissertation research of then-PhD student [Eric Schulman](https://sites.google.com/view/ericschulman) (now at the Congressional Budget Office) on his project *"[Essays on Model Selection](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/items/32b92566-1074-4a12-9f0d-8395793b537a)".* My tasks involved literature review and data analysis.
We collaborated on several projects covering various topics in applied econometrics and game theory. Related project repositories are included below:
