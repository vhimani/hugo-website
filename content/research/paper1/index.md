I completed an undergraduate thesis in partial fulfillment of [Special Honors](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/economics/undergraduate-program/academic-opportunities/econ-honors/) in the Department of Economics at UT Austin under the supervision of [Prof. Andreas Mueller](https://sites.google.com/view/andreasimueller/). My research used an instrumental variables model to estimate how foregone market work hours are reallocated across different activity categories, including non-market work, job search, childcare, leisure, and other uses. I employed Stata for data processing and Python for tabulation and visualization. I also presented my research at the [16th Annual Economics Scholars Program Conference for Undergraduate Research, hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas](https://www.dallasfed.org/educate/events/2022/22esp).

##### Abstract

This paper analyzes the impact of the pandemic on allocation of time across different working, home production, and leisure categories. The findings are compared against
trends during the Great Recession. Additionally, differences among gender groups during the pandemic are evaluated from a time use perspective. Using the American Time
Use Survey data from 2003 to 2020 and an instrumental variables approach, I find that about 34 percent of the foregone market work hours are substituted towards non-
market work. Leisure absorbs hours from other categories like job search and childcare, and combined with market work, constitute about 126 percent of all foregone market hours during the pandemic period. There are significant decreases in time spent on job search, childcare, socializing, and other civic activities. Overall women spent more time towards childcare, and the difference is significantly higher for single women with younger children. I discuss the implications of my results for business cycle models studying substitution behavior among gender groups and non-separable preferences of people between leisure and market work.
